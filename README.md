# Quantium-Retail-Strategy-and-Analytics

## Introduction

This project is part of a **job simulation hosted by Quantium** on **Forage**, designed to give participants real-world experience in retail data analytics. Quantium is a data science and AI company that partners with leading organizations to help them make data-driven decisions.

In this simulation, I stepped into the role of a **Retail Data Analyst**, working on a request from the **Category Manager for Chips**, who needed insights into customer purchasing behavior across the chip category. The aim is to uncover trends in chip purchases, understand customer segments, and provide actionable recommendations to support the **supermarket's chip strategy for the next six months**.

The simulation consists of three parts. This repository focuses on **Part 1: Data Preparation and Customer Analytics**, which covers cleaning the data, exploring customer behavior, and identifying meaningful customer segments.

**Note:** A complete summary of the project and insights is available in the PDF report included in this repository.

## Project Objectives

This phase of the project focuses on preparing the data for analysis and extracting key insights on chip buying behavior. The main objectives are:

**1. Data Cleaning & Preparation**

  * Inspect transaction and customer datasets for nulls, inconsistencies, and outliers.
  * Ensure category filtering is correctly applied to isolate chip products only.
  * Clean and standardize relevant numeric and categorical fields.
  * Merge customer and transaction data into a usable analysis dataset.

**2. Exploratory Data Analysis**

  * Analyze total chip sales, purchasing trends, and key drivers of sales.
  * Identify high-performing customer segments and regional behavior.
  * Visualize insights using charts and graphs.

**3. Customer Segmentation**

  * Group customers based on purchasing behavior and demographic features.
  * Investigate relationships between segment behavior and packet size preference.
  * Prepare actionable insights and strategic recommendations for targeting.

### Tools Used

* **Python**

  * Used as the primary language for data analysis.

* **Python Libraries:**

  * `pandas` – for data cleaning, merging, and manipulation.
  * `numpy` – for numerical operations.
  * `matplotlib` & `seaborn` – for data visualization and trend analysis.

* **Jupyter Notebook**

  * Used for interactive development, exploration, and presentation of code and insights.
